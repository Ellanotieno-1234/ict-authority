2. Add more interactive chart features
3. Implement cross-chart interactions
4. Add data export functionality

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests for data processing functions
2. Integration tests for real-time updates
3. Performance testing for large datasets
4. End-to-end testing for user interactions
